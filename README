/*
* House Panel PHP application for SmartThings
* author: Ken Washington  (c) 2017
*
* general purpose routines included for authorizing a web service
* specific application shows all switches, motion sensors, and door contacts
* thermostats and doors to open and other capabilities will be added later
*
* for switches the Ajax call is used to turn the switch on and off from the web
* DEBUG flags can be used to show specific data details during installation
* this must be paired with the HousePanel SmartApp on the SmartThings side
*
* CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and ST_WEB must be in a file called clientinfo.php
* which must look as follows:
*
* HousePanel is now part of Open-Dash
*
<?php
define('CLIENT_ID', 'abc1abc1-abc2-abc3-abc4-abc5abc5abc5');
define('CLIENT_SECRET', 'abc1abc1-abc2-abc3-abc4-abc5abc5abc5');
define('ST_WEB','https://graph.api.smartthings.com');

* real data for CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are found in SmartThings
* after you enable OAUTH2 in the SmartApp panel
*
* Finally, install all files in any web server and you should be good to go
* While any web server will do, I strongly recommend one with SSL or using
* a local webserver on a Raspberry Pi that sits behind your home firewall
* and on the same network as your ST hub. This will make the app run fast.
